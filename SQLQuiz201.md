**Section 1 : Times and Totals**<br><br>

Imagine we have a table called purchases with purchase IDs, amounts, and times the purchase were made. Letâ€™s say it looks like this:<br>

Now let's calculate the sum of purchases made on Feb 1 by using the following query.<br><br>

```
SELECT
    SUM(amount) AS sum
FROM purchases
WHERE
    dt = '2023-02-15'
```

And that gives us this result.<br><br>

What happened? There were three purchases made on Feb 15: IDs 1, 2, and 3. The sum should therefore be $26.97. Instead, only the first purchase was counted.
