--Here is a simple query that retrieves some information about hotel reservations
--You run this query "today"

SELECT
	acct.Fullname,
	acct.Custid,
	res.ReservationID,
	res.ReservationStartDate,
	res.ReservationesEndDate,
	res.RoomRate,
	hotel.HotelName
FROM
  customeraccounts as acct
LEFT JOIN reservations as res on r.custid = c.custid
LEFT JOIN hotel as hotel on h.hotelid = r.hotelid
WHERE
  acct.Status = 'Active' 
  AND res.ResStartDate between convert(datetime, '2021-01-01 00:00:00.0000') AND convert(datetime, '2021-12-31 23:59:59.9999')

-- 1. Describe what this query is trying to do.
-- 2. When the query runs, I see rows with blank data for ReservationID and HotelName; why is that happening?
-- 3. I wanted to see every reservation made in 2021 but this isn't showing all of them.  How could the query be changed to make that happen?
